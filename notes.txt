. maybe do some message passing achitecture

. plan
  . import relevent notes from thrombe/musimanager
  . a floating widget
    . pressing a shortcut brings up another terminal window on the current screen with with a few options
      for switching songs and stuff
      . somehow add way to apply certain WM property things like keep_above_others and stuff from opts
    . this can be another mode that the program can run in (cli args)
    . use a files to share state between main app and this window
  . musitags
    . apply tags to songs/song_providers
    . tags like: fav, good, maybe_good, pop, metal, ...
    . tags so that songs can be quick filtered for listening based on listeners mood
    . song provider can then choose random songs based on tags
  . fetch song metadata from some sites
    . do a sound search and ask user to pick song name after showing the search results
  . a song recommender using yt recommendation with filters
    . filters like:
      . dont show from known artists
      . filter known songs
  . multiple profiles with simple way to switch from cli args
    . profiles with different opts and different db
  . keep a executor thread that is polled for checking completion on each main loop iteration
    and do the thing required when it finally returns
    . this way i dont have to use mutexes and iternal mutability for doing things on parallel
